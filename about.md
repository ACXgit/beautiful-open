well designed. It's  built and curated by [@trek](http://twitter.com/trek).


## Submissions
We don't accept all submissions.  All submissions must follow the instructions
on the *How to submit* section below. We reserve the right to reject any
submission. Submissions with inappropriate content will not be accepted.

## How to submit
To submit a site suggestion,
[open an issue](https://github.com/trek/beautiful-open/issues/new)
or [create a pull request](https://github.com/trek /beautiful-open/pulls/new).
Pull requests will be given higher priority since
they are easier to include. Make sure the screenshot is 1000x800 and please
double check that everything looks good before submitting. It's also a good
idea to run the screenshot through an image optimizer like
[TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before including it. This will help keep the
website fast and the repository small as possible.

## About the site
Inspired by [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/)
and [Built WithEmber](http://builtwithember.io/). It's built with
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), developed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/trek /beautiful-open), and is hosted
on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
