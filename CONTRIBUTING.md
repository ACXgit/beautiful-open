# Contributing

## New submissions

  1. One submission per Issue or Pull Request
  1. Please name your file `xxxx-xx-xx-<name>.md` where `<name>` is
     replaced with the name of your site, e.g. `xxxx-xx-xx-emberjs.md`.
     I will supply the date when publishing the site.
  1. Make sure the screenshot is **1000x800** and please double check that
     everything looks good before submitting.
  1. Run the screenshot through an image optimizer like
     [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) or [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/)
     before including it. This will help keep the website fast and the repository
     small as possible.

Not all submissions will be accepted. This is just the nature of curation. Please
don't ask me to explain _why_ I decided not to include a site on the list: Gituhb
Issues aren't a great venue for design critique.
